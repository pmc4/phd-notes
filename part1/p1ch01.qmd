::: column-margin
Some margin notes that we write. The template is inspired in Tufte-book.
:::

## This is a section
For $x\ll1$ one can approximate

$$
\sin(x) \approx x
$$ {#eq-sin}

This is a table:

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

: Test Table {#tbl-my_table}

I can reference @eq-sin and @tbl-my_table. The output is correct, but I cannot autocomplete them in my extension.

In this template we also have some index entries\index{index example} and also the glossaries package. But that shouldn't be a problem. Since glossaries are compiled after quarto render with the tex output.

Here we cite @Einstein:1916vd.

## Explanation of the project structure
* `_book`contains the output pdf
* `backmatter` contains the list of acronyms defined for the Latex package glossaries, the .bib file for references, the .csl for the citeproc style and a references.qmd file since we want to have all the references at the end of the book, not after every chapter.
* `fonts` contains the fonts used by the project
* `frontmatter` contains the chapters for the frontmatter of the template
* `latex` contains several .tex template partials and the style to be used by the imakeidx package
* `part1` contains a `p1.qmd` file which has the part title, a `p1chapters.qmd` file in which we include each different chapter of page 1. This way I don't have a really long .yml file and can change the title of the chapter outside the chapter .qmd file. Finally, `ch999.qmd` is just a .qmd file that I include to restore the geometry of the tex file so we no longer use Tufte's style.
* `_quarto.yml` is the usual _quarto file and `index.qmd` is the entry point. It includes the frontmatter chapters.
* `buildpdf.sh` is a shell script that I use when I want to render the acronym list of the glossaries package
